# AI200 Capstone Project
The goal of the project is to classify bots from an online auction bidding dataset. 

Two datasets were given:
1. A dataset containing list of bidder information. 
2. A dataset containing more than a million bids on different auctions.

There was a strong focus on feature engineering to create features that could help models effectively classify bots from humans in the datasets.
My team of three was fortunate to come up first in the course Kaggle private leaderboard with an AUC score of 0.90194.
